Eating just a handful of California walnuts, which are packed with 2.5g plant-based omega-3 ALA, 4g protein, and 2g fiber, keeps me fueled and focused throughout the day. \u00a0\n\nCalifornia walnuts are a smart choice. The ideal climate, fertile soils, and the farmers dedication to providing high quality make them one of the best options available in the market. They combine nutrition, versatility, high quality, exceptional flavour and so much more. That\u2019s why I say #ThinkWalnutsThinkCalifornia\n\nCalifornia walnuts are available at all grocery stores and e-commerce sites. Make sure to look for the California Walnuts logo mark, \u201cCalifornia\u201d or \u201cCalifornian\u201d on the package or produce of the USA to ensure that you are buying genuine, high-quality California walnuts.\n#CaliforniaWalnuts\n"

It was truly an enthralling experience visiting various stalls put up by the students promoting their business ideas. I truly appreciate the vision of the school, through which they are empowering students to tap into their untapped potential, and are giving them opportunities to step into the world of entrepreneurship. To be an entrepreneur one needs to have at-least 10 possible moves for their business and ideas for execution, calculative mind, consistency and more over courage. And watching these kids carrying these core values with utmost confidence, truly inspired me and I was in an aww. Right from 5 to 18 years of age, so many young minds sharing their vision was indeed a treat to watch. Well success is not an event, it\u2019s a process. My best wishes to these students as they embark on the journey of becoming successful entrepreneurs in near future.\n\nOutfit By- @vibgyor.boutique_ @bhogsunil\n"

Kudos to the author who so well has crafted a story with so many characters and each one of them with different layers and back stories. It\u2019s a book that has every ingredient required for a perfect drama thriller. It has love, friendships, relationships, politics, greed, jealousy, adulatory, lust and more. It took me a couple of sitting to read the book as after few chapters I felt like analysing the characters and their stories as to their reasoning for their particular sin. It\u2019s a story about umpteenth sins but all for one reason love. But the catch here is love for different emotions. Deep right!!! Hence I would says it\u2019s a story with a lot of depth. To give you a little snippet it\u2019s a story of three main characters Shaaman, Maya and Aahil. As maya arrives in Delhi to meet her husband Shaaman family and for a celebration, mysterious deaths start taking place in the house and what should have been a celebration turns catastrophic. There is a story between maya and aahil too which is sinful. Now you may wonder who is Aahil but if I tell you anything more it would be a spoiler. I would recommend you to read and unravel the mystery yourself. I also have to when I read the last book penned by the author I was amazed at the nail biting suspense thriller as I couldn\u2019t till the end guess what was in store for me but here again she has amazed me and broken her own record with another suspense thriller. It\u2019s a book I would recommend all mystery lovers who would like to have an amazing thrilling time.\n"

The Cursed Gem part 2 is when the lord of the past The Maharathi Ashwatthama reappears for the cursed gen and the wars between the kingdoms for two reasons to conquer and the old mystic weapon Divya Astra which is with Ujjayini Kingdom and also wanting to bring the fiend all to the glory of Ujjayni kingdom. All the characters and the plots are very well crafted. The story progresses flawlessly and smoothly inspite of so many characters. The writing and narration style of author makes the book very visualistic. The author through the stories and learning\u2019s that he shares between the characters makes the narrative more engaging.

The best part of the tales if that it\u2019s in a chronological order and you cannot start randomly from any chapter. I had set a ritual of either reading a couple of tales in the morning or at night before going to bed. The stories are complimented with a few illustrations throughout the book which I am going to colour soon and still be connected to the book. The author has narrated the Mahagatha in such a simple and entertaining way that you get glued and can visualise the entire yugas. With his words he transports you to the 250 CE to 1500 CE. #i highly recommend this one if you want to enlighten yourselves with Hindu mythology in an entertaining way.\n"

The book is narrated in a chatty and a sectoral style which makes the read interesting and you sublimely are an integral part of the story. As the title suggest the book is about Shakuntala Bassi the bride to be and her father Ramswarup Bassi. Well Shakuntala has rejected thousand of boys but now she is rejected by Jacky Zinta by her dream man for a bizarre reason and we all know how difficult it is to take rejection. So anyways this father- daughter due team up to make Jacky agree to marriage. Also I guess all father and daughters will relate to it either the situations or the bond that Shakuntala and Ramswarup share. The question that lies here and the stories begins will they succeed?

What an intriguing title it\u2019s a short novella with small chapters which makes it a day or two to read. It was my first book of the year and I thoroughly enjoyed reading this piece of fiction penned by Jayanthi as the narration style is fresh and I also like the style of storytelling specially the format. There are many other quotes and sub plots that I loved in the story  that I am itching to tell you all but I shouldn\u2019t land up giving you all spoilers. I rather have you\u2019ll discover it but never the less let me tell you a little about the story Susan is a kid from Goa and she has found a pen pal from Singapore Suiyi who is of the same age and they share their emotion through their letters. ( It took me back in time when I had a pen pal from Nagpur and I enjoying writing my heart out to her) back to the story they both have turbulent personal lives and though both are in different places and have different journeys in life they are still very connected. The author through her story and characters portage strong human behaviours, emotions; she has laid out beautiful different complexities and challenges that each one of us face within our circle with our closed ones or with the ones in our surroundings.\nI would recommend this book to everyone who enjoy fiction and emotions that feel inspired from real life events and are looking for a quick thrill read to start their reading challenge.\n"

The book has some fresh air and as you read and the story keeps unfolding it will amaze you. It\u2019s a story not only about life but also about Afterlife. I liked the narration style of the author ( here would like to bring a little thing to your notice that avid readers don\u2019t go on the language just read and flow with the story and the characters. Dwell deep into that) for the beginners it\u2019s apt will make you fall in love with reading too as it\u2019s a short book with a powerful story which you can read at one go or in a couple of sittings.

Special claps for the author for his research as the book contains a lot of historical information which will excite the history enthusiast. The narrative style of the author takes you in the past of these historical figures, his descriptive style makes you feel you are in that era. The entire scene comes to life. The cliffhanger that the author leaves you at makes you want to read the other parts soon. I am impatiently waiting for the sequels to follow.

They were both man and woman, had four arms, four legs and a single head made of two faces.\nHumans were very powerful creatures, fearless and strong, and even dared to threat the Gods. They threatened to conquer them and rule in their stead, and become the new Gods. So the Gods had to answer, and contemplated on how to face the humans\u2019 threat. They thought of destroying humans completely, face them in a battle and kill them with lightning, as they did with the Titans. But if humans no longer were, there would also be no more tributes to Gods from the humans, a thought that the Gods did not enjoy at all.\nSo Zeus came up with another solution. They would split the humans in half and punish them for their pride and hubris. Apart from the pain that would cause them, they would also double the population of humans, hence doubling the tributes that had to be made to them by humans. And so they did and the humans everywhere split in two. These new creatures were living in complete misery, drenched in their pain and sorrow. They were so sad that they wouldn\u2019t eat or drink for days, not caring if they died.\nApollo, God of music, truth and prophecy, healing, and light, could not bear see them like this, so to ease their pain, he sewed them up, reconstituted their body forms and just left the navel as the only reminder of their original form. So, humans went from double face and double sex creatures with eight limbs, to single faced ones of a single sex, with two arms and two legs. And they forever longed for their soul and physical other half. Their physical nature would feel a burning desire to be completed with the physical nature of the other sex, and their soul alike would yearn for their soul\u2019s other half be complete, their soulmate. And according to the myth, when these two halves find each other, there will be a silent understanding of one another, they will feel joined and exist with each other in unison and will know no greater joy than that.\nHappy Anniversary Shloka-Akash. \n@shloka11 @aambani1\n"

Feeling this deep emotion, however, doesn\u2019t take away from the fact that I am also a very ambitious and hardworking woman who loves building my own legacy that Dua can one day be proud of. \n\nWe can experience both emotions without disregarding the other and we can cherish our roles as mothers and still pursue other passions. But ultimately this is a choice, and it is mine to make. \n\nI respect mothers that make the choices that most resonate with their values, and this does not have to be the same choice as mine. \nMy wish is that we all respect mothers and the choices we make without jumping to label anyone as a \u201cbad mother\u201d when we never know the full story. \n\nI know Dua is having so much fun with her Dad, and this time they have together is also valuable for both of them.

The fashion cycle is constant but there are still moments that ground us in artistry and tradition. The Gucci Jackie 1961 bag is one such moment.\n\u00a0\nA key design of The House for decades, the Jackie has been reimagined several times over the years. Its newest incarnation, the #GucciJackie1961, beholds the Jackie story, but with a new perspective. An emblematic bag known for its half-moon shape, pared-down silhouette, and sleek piston hardware now carries itself with a non-binary attitude, transcending social constructs and time itself.\n\nThe Jackie 1961 boldly takes on any outfit, perfect for any occasion with its timeless elegance. To me, the Gucci Jackie 1961 bag represents an identity that is always growing but nevertheless stays connected to the core of its beauty.\n"

Consider that the Mirai is a California-only model and suddenly that \u2018Limited\u2019 badge on the trunk means more than just the $66,000+ price tag.\n\nFilling it up is like filling it up with gas, except you have to do it at hydrogen stations which are few and far between (once you\u2019ve waited behind the other Mirai owners, see photo). It then operates like an EV. In essence, this feels like a fat 4,300 lb electric Camry except it powers the rear wheels and rides softer. Make no mistake, It\u2019s an incredibly pleasant companion.\n\nThe 300 lb ft of torque is immediate and smooth, although the 182 hp means that past the initial push it chills out HARD, achieving a 9+ second 0-60. It wins traffic lights, not quarter miles. I\u2019ve included a video.\n\nThe cabin, despite the vehicle\u2019s length (same as a BMW 5 Series) is surprisingly modest in size. The trunk isn\u2019t huge either. But like the Crown we just tested, it feels lexus-lite, although a smidge last gen. Plush seats, nice materials. And a JBL sound system that ACTUALLY has some bass. The new Prius, the Corollas and the Crown would like to share some of that please.\n\nIt was $108 to fill up at the station from almost empty. That\u2019s supposed to give me 400 miles of range but for some reason it was showing 285. Yeah not cheap, BUT IT CLEANS THE AIR AS IT DRIVES. And it also pisses out the bottom when you click the H2O button. So that\u2019s fun.\n\nIn theory, this is better than EV or ICE. It drives like an EV, which is superior in every way for a daily driver and yet you can fill it up in just a few minutes. That's the best of both worlds, no?\n\nI googled why it isn\u2019t more popular and got this: \u201cThe vast majority of car companies have turned away from hydrogen because of the high density of energy consumed in its production, as well as poor funding and backing from governments.\u201d\n\nThat and I\u2019m sure all the would-be owners don\u2019t want to pay 70 Gs just to deal with Hindenburg jokes all day.\n\nThe Mirai is an expensive way to drive guilt-free, but if you can make it work, more power to you. (And more power to the Mirai please).\n\n@jamesengelsman\n"

It\u2019s hard to admit this on such a public forum but\u2026I do oftentimes skip leg day. And guess what, so does the 2023 Toyota Highlander Hybrid. Change the badge though, and this thing is a Lexus. Sort of. \n\nI say it skips leg day because it produces 243hp from a 2.5L 4-cyl hybrid and takes almost 9 seconds to hit 60mph. The CVT also groans monotonously until the end of time while you do it. And somehow I STILL like this car. Bizarre.\n\nAnd that\u2019s not even the end of my complaints. The heated seats max out at 30-minute-old-cadaver levels of warm and the head-up display compass was stuck on North no matter which direction I faced. And yet STILL, I\u2019m a fan of this car. Why?\n\nPrice. Optioned to the max for 59K CAD/49K USD, you get a comfortable, 35mpg, awd, three-row, nicely riding, well insulated Toyota that drives perfectly fine and has all the tech you could ever need, at the touch of actual buttons. The JBL sound system is good, the rear camera and 360 tech blows Honda out of the water and did I mention the seats are lovely? The ventilated part works very well, as does the heated steering wheel.\n\nAnd the cabin, how is this not a Lexus? From soft touch materials to varnished woods, this thing feels like a classy product. First impressions in the driveway, I couldn\u2019t understand why it only costs what it does.\n\nOnly once I started using the throttle did I notice the cost savings. Goes slow, sounds awful and CVTs can go die now please. Spoiler: I now have an RX500h in the driveway that truly demonstrates what a 4 cylinder hybrid, when paired with a six speed transmission, can be like.\n\nBut if you can get over that, I think the Highlander is as good as it looks (okay yes a Kia Telluride looks cooler) and no doubt there are those that would champion the cheaper non-hybrid trims, but my neighbour\u2019s shiny new Highlander Hybrid has already been stolen off his driveway and shipped overseas (Sorry about that, Ian) so I\u2019d say it's certainly desirable enough.\n\nWords on the RX500h coming soon.\n\n@jamesengelsman\n"

Review:\n\nShort of the Audi S8, of all the press cars I\u2019ve had since arriving in LA (Mirai, Highlander, Sequoia, RX, Cayman GTS, Urus P) it was the car I most loathed to give back. The GTI fits my life like a glove.\n\n\u2018Hot hatch\u2019 is generous. Compared to FWD things like the Elantra N or Civic Type R, it's very much a warm hatch. It's got speed, sure, but it's very German everywhere else. Comfortable, refined, solid. Hair raising, it is not.\n\nThe key tag said Autobahn, but I accidentally had the base model. Which means this little 241hp manual pocket rocket squeezes in at a price of US$30,530.\n\nAmong other things, this robbed me of the upgraded Harman Kardon, the adaptive dampers, sunroof, bigger screen, fancy 19\u201d wheels and leather seats. I can skip the last four (I love the plaid), but the only two I felt like I was missing were the sound system and the dampers. The ride was a little busy even on LA roads.\n\nSeats are excellent, the driving position is ergonomic perfection and buttons aside (I\u2019m coming to that), what a great steering wheel to grip. Lovely texture and diameter.\n\nPracticality is astounding. I managed to fit our entire TH team\u2019s production gear and everything my wife and I brought with us to LA in it. No small feat.\n\nIt\u2019s delightfully zippy and well sized. Parallel park it in the city, easy. Rip through a canyon, easy. Slice through traffic, piece o\u2019 cake. And all with four full-grown adults.\n\nAggressive shifting with the manual is not rewarded and is my only driving-related issue, especially the 1-2 shift but such is the price for FWD. The R fixes that and would probably be my pick.\n\nWhat the R doesn\u2019t fix is the interior. Mine had a volume knob (base model) but even still the steering wheel buttons are, at best, not at all satisfying. And two clicks to get to the heated seats after pressing the heated seat icon is dumb. But wireless carplay worked flawlessly.\n\nI think the MK8 looks absolutely class. It takes the already handsome MK7 and streamlines it as if hit by a scirocco wind (see what I did there). I would own one in a heartbeat, interior gripes and all.\n\n@jamesengelsman\n"

The infotainment is dumb.\n\nI\u2019ll get to that second point but I just lived with this car for 5 days and I\u2019m mixed on it. \n\nIt's very pretty. It also has a delightfully clean-looking interior and the ground clearance required to not be intimidated by LA\u2019s silly dips in the road.\n\nLike the other \u2018subcompact crossovers,\u2019 it handles like a hatch that\u2019s just had a big lunch. It\u2019s confident enough but compared to the GTI that I traded it with, it doesn\u2019t feel nearly as tight, nor is the ride quality as good. I\u2019m sure the torsion beam has something to do with that, as well as the heightened CoG.\n\nThere\u2019s no denying that for $35K (US), a 250 hp AWD CUV with a 0-60 time of 5.8 seconds just needs to drive\u2026fine, and it does. It\u2019s powerful, though the 2.5 turbo trades fuel economy for speed (25mpg).\n\nThe steering is a strong point and it\u2019s tuned lighter on the 30 than on the 50, which I'm very grateful for as it is far better suited to its class. AND in a rare un-Mazda like move, the seats are actually comfy. Driving position is good and its sleek exterior lines didn\u2019t inhibit my visibility as much as I thought it might.\n\nRear seat space is compromised compared to the CX5/50s and annoyingly the back seats don\u2019t fold flat. \n\nIt\u2019s missing wireless CarPlay and a good LKA. Also, Mazda\u2019s obsession with removing touchscreens has reached its ultimate form. I include a video of me attempting to change the music with the dial only. Apple\u2019s UI is partly to blame but all of that could have been fixed by letting me touch it. In fairness, my Audi was guilty of the same crime so keen marketers can now claim the CX-30 has an \u201cAudi level interior\u201d. Add to that, on multiple occasions since, the screen simply hasn\u2019t responded to my inputs at all. The CX-30s way of telling me to \u2018sit and spin.\u2019\n\nThe subcompact crossover might be the least sexy class of vehicle of all time. But with soul red crystal clothing, good power and sleek looks, the CX-30 Turbo does what it can to make your trousers move. But it\u2019s not perfect.\n\n@jamesengelsman\n"

This was the opposite, I warmed to the RX over time. But not completely.\n\nThe good: It hustles. The last two cars I had this month (Mirai, Highlander) were both 9 seconds to 60, so the sub 6 second time of the RX500h felt like lightspeed. And it has a hybrid FOUR cylinder! One that makes, wait for it\u2026\n\n366 hp and 406 lb ft. That\u2019s about as good as it gets for a 4-cyl this side of an AMG. It feels genuinely quick and doesn\u2019t sound bad doing it either. The powertrain, ahead of cabin isolation, is by far the highlight of this car. Matched nicely to the six-speed transmission, it is both smooth and effective.\n\nWe said the Highlander and the Crown feel lexus-like in the cabin and you know what, the Toyotas are definitely nipping at the heels of Lexus quality now. This isn\u2019t a huge step up and in fact the roof had a constant creak that I wasn\u2019t able to diagnose.\n\nThe seats are great and the Mark Levinson audio is superior to anything in a Toyota but some things are a step backward. I don\u2019t mind the bigger screen but toggling between carplay and the native app is completely unintuitive. Also, modifying the cluster requires getting to second base with the steering wheel touch buttons while looking at the head up display to see what menu you\u2019re changing [video in carousel]. A seemingly complex and unnecessary way to \u201cget one over\u201d on a Toyota.\n\nIt handles its 4,750 lb weight pretty well but it feels heavy in the corners. The Highlander felt more spry even with the third row.\n\nStyling may sell you on this Copper Crest coloured RX. And really it IS rather nice, but at 90K CAD as specced, it's expensive. The Germans and the Genesis stuff are stiff competition at that price. Given the choice, I\u2019d stick this powertrain in the Highlander and call it a day, even if that made the Highlander $10k more.

All vehicles that have absolutely nailed their assignment..\n\nAdd the Bronco Raptor to that list. We\u2019ve said it since we first drove the regular Bronco: Ford got it right.\n\nI was lucky enough to enter the desert once again with a Bronco Raptor, mere moments after the dust had settled from this year\u2019s King Of The Hammers. I took my brother and brother-in-law and attempted to do what Bronco owners do, which is go out alone without a support vehicle and spend the whole time saying \u201cSee that hill? This could definitely handle that,\u201d and then proceed not to do it because coward.\n\nSaying that, we tinkled with some baja, we rock crawled and we sped up some sandy hills. All well within the comfort zone of the Bronco Raptor (and most probably a normal Bronco).\n\nUnlike last time, when Thomas and I had about 5 hours in the desert with the Bronco Raptor, I had a full week living with it, which meant LA highways, parking in the city, grocery runs and canyon carving.\n\nOut of the box, there is pretty much nothing the Bronco Raptor can\u2019t do. I find Wranglers ridiculously charming, and their narrower dimensions and solid axle might win rock-crawling, but I\u2019d sacrifice that for the Bronco\u2019s better road manners. It\u2019s size is definitely daunting, but its turning radius is impressive all things considered. And yes, it's loud on the highway.\n\nThe F-150 Raptor has a nicer ride, and sounds a little better with its tromboner exhaust, but the sheer road presence of the Braptor means that it\u2019s absolutely loved by passersby. It\u2019s for the G Wagon owner that has decided to stop kicking puppies.\n\nThematically, it feels like a petrol counterpart to a Rivian R1S. Take that how you will. But here\u2019s the good news, I don\u2019t think it needs the Raptor treatment. A normal Bronco can do everything I did on this trip. I know that because I\u2019ve literally done the same stuff with a Badlands trim. The extra power is nice but the cost saving is significant, and you haven\u2019t got to play your local dealer\u2019s prick like a whistle to get one. \n\nEither way, please enjoy photos by my brother @danengelsphoto \n\n-@jamesengelsman\n"

Double down on that feeling and distance yourself, shut down, get more mad, stew on negative feelings, get in fights. ie cause more of the *same*\n\nOr \n\nB. IOA: immediate opposite action: flip the madness and challenge yourself to increase closeness, get present and kind. Ask questions. Hold space. Open up. Work through to a higher level. Generate what you really want: LOVE.\n\nFunny how so many of life\u2019s great improvements come from sensing negative feelings and then doing something to bring good things in versus double down on the pain. \n\nYou can feel the feeling, acknowledge and understand it, but not be controlled by it and make a BETTER CHOICE. \n\nThat\u2019s free will and conscious behavior that changes your life. \n\nShare with someone today.

A statement was posted online by his parents:\n\n\"Dave Hollis, former President of Worldwide Distribution at Disney, passed away peacefully at his home outside Austin, TX on Saturday night. Though exact cause of death has yet to be determined, his family confirms he had been hospitalized recently for some heart issues. He was 47.\u201d \n\nDave was a good man, a loving father, an inspiring teacher, and a dear friend. \n\nWe spent a lot of time together. I loved his caring and empathy, his energy and enthusiasm, his vulnerability in sharing his struggles, and his love of his children and helping people. \n\nWe taught for a year together and the depth of his sharing and wisdom had me and our audience in tears so many times.\n\nI loved our funny conversations, how he taught, how many great laughs and grand plans we shared. \n\nWe were just together last month with friends when he was hospitalized with heart-related issues. He was released okay and I got to share with him then our love for him then, as did our friends. He knew he was loved. \nIt sounds like those heart health issues continued. \n\nWe are sending our love, prayers and condolences to his family and all our shared friends and communities saddened by this news today. \n\nIt feels unreal- Tomorrow would have been Dave's birthday. \n\nPlease pray for his family and give them space and prayer. \n\nI will miss you my brother. \nRest In Peace dear friend.\n\ud83d\ude4f\u2764\ufe0f\n@mrdavehollis\n"

About halfway through part 2, I realized that I have several stories I have been holding onto and will follow the process to re-write them and develop a new Narrator. Similar to Megan\u2019s story about the fear of public speaking, mine is more about speaking up in meetings because no one will ever take me seriously, so I never bother. Just applying the first step, I realized that is not even supported with the data I have. Which prompted me to dig deeper into all the other stories I kept telling myself. Needless to say, if you ever wanted to break a cycle that you are in, reading this book will force you to confront those stories and make you ask if they are true.\u2060\n\u2060\nI cannot express how much I appreciate Michael and Megan for sharing their stories and research throughout this book.\u2060\n\u2060\nIf you are looking to make a meaningful change in 2023, read this book and do the work. You may just find the breakthrough you need to make your dreams or goals possible.

It\u2019s practically a manual on how to pivot when you need.\u2060\n\u2060\nYour goals matter. That\u2019s why you set them in the first place. Don\u2019t let them die like a plant you forgot to water. Keep them visible, stay connected to your why, and change your approach until you reach your destination.\u2060\n"

A wish is a vague aspiration like \u201cget healthy\u201d or \u201cmake more money\u201d or \u201cfall in love.\u201d A goal, on the other hand, is a specific, actionable intention. It\u2019s something you can do. \u2060\n\u2060\nA study out of Duke University found that people with more specific goals gained more momentum and grew in motivation as they progressed, while people with less specific goals had the opposite tendency. They lost steam along the way and reported a decline in motivation, even when they made some progress. \u2060\n\u2060\nSo the trick is to sharpen your expectations into specific goals that you can do something about.\u2060\n"

It was a comfortable life, but deep down, I knew I was meant for something more.\n\nOne day, I took a leap of faith and decided to pursue my passion for coaching. I poured my heart and soul into building my business, determined to create transformation in the lives of many.\n\nIt wasn't easy, but with hard work and dedication, I managed to build a thriving coaching business that reached 7 figures.\n\nAs fate would have it, I was given the opportunity to feature in a documentary film called Think & Grow Rich.\n\nIt was an incredible honor to be a part of such a renowned project, and even more so, to attend the red carpet event alongside inspiring individuals like Rob Drydek, Lewis Howes, Barbara Corcoran and Bob Proctor. \n\nLooking back, I realize that my dreams were always within reach. It wasn't about being lucky or having connections, but about leading with service and becoming an entrepreneur that genuinely cares about making a difference in the world.\n\nMy journey is a testament to the fact that anyone can achieve their dreams if they have the courage to pursue them. It's never too late to take that leap of faith and become the person you were always meant to be. May my story inspire you to follow your heart and create the life of your dreams.\n\nIf you\u2019d love to learn how to build a legit 7 figure coaching business online so you can work from anywhere then DM me the word \u2018FREEDOM\u2019 and let\u2019s have a chat. I have something to share with you.\n\n\u2014\n\nHave you stayed in your home town or ventured out? I\u2019d love to know and would love to know why. Drop a comment below \ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffc\n"
